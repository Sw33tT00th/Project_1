Not much to say here in terms of instructions

Makefile command to build the application is "make all"

Command to run the application correctly is: ./ppmrw [3|6] <input_file> <output_destination>

The 3 or 6 determines what format the output file is written in.

To remove the compiled file run "make clean"
